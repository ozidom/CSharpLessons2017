# CSharpLessons2017

The Solution is DotNetCore2 so you’ll need to install DotNetCore2 from https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos

Work through the lessons in this order:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Just switch branch when you want to move to the new lesson. There’s notes and tasks as well as the solution code.

Basically everything for the OO stuff is all in Program.cs .I have added classes into this file so that everything is easy to explain over hangouts but if you think thats bad just fork this repo and create seperate files for each class.
